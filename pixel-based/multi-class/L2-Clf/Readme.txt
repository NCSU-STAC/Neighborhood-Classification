# How to run code
# Use the ipython notebook if you wish to identify optimal hyperparamters
# Use generate-training-models.py if you wish to generate the training models using the optimal hyperparameters generated for the data
#  generate-training-models.py will also print out the test accuracies
# use classifyImage.py to classify over entire image 
# usage of classifyImage.py: python classifyImage.py STARTING_ROW_NUMBER ENDING_ROW_NUMBER
# If you have a HPC cluster, compile and run predict.c to predict multiple sections simultaneously
